There was not enough time to finish with GraphQL, I had to spend more time on design and fixing designer errors, such as: 
1) Some PNG icons were not centered and found in rectangles, which is a bug - had to fix this with additional styles
2) A part of the design was inserted in Zeplin just like a picture, from which it was impossible to get or find out the font sizes, indents, colors, shadow darkening, shadow transparency, icon size and much more - I had to do this part of the work approximately like in the design.
